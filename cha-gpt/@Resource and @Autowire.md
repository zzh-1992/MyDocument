# the diference between @Resource and @Autowire

`@Resource` is a standard annotation defined in the `Java EE specification`,
and it is used to inject a resource by name.
The name specified in the annotation must match the name of a resource
defined in the application context. If no name is specified,
the default name is derived from the field or method name.

On the other hand, `@Autowired` is a `Spring-specific annotation`
that is used to inject dependencies automatically. It can be used to inject any bean,
including other Spring-managed beans, such as repositories, services, and controllers.
When using @Autowired, Spring looks for a bean of the required `type` and injects it automatically.
If there are multiple beans of the same type,
you can use the `@Qualifier` annotation to specify which bean to inject.

The main difference between the two annotations is that @Resource is a standard Java annotation,
while @Autowired is a Spring-specific annotation. Additionally, @Resource injects by name, 
while @Autowired injects by type. This means that @Autowired is more flexible 
since it allows you to inject any bean of a particular type, whereas @Resource requires you to specify the exact name 
of the bean you want to inject. However, @Resource allows you to inject non-Spring-managed
objects, such as JDBC connections or JMS destinations, which may not be possible with @Autowired.
