或许描述我研究数学的经历最恰当的的比方就是进入一个黑暗的大宅中

Because, when one goes into the first room and it`s dark,completely dark 

one stumbles around bumping into the furniture

gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is,

and finally after six months or so you find the light switch,you turn it on.

suddenly it`s illuminated,you can see exactly where you were.

At the beginning of September I was sitting here ath this desk.

when suddenly,totally unexpectedly,I had this incredible revelation.

It was the most important moment of my working life.

Nothing I ever do again
========================\

This is the story of one man`s  obsession with the world`s greatest mathematical problem.

For seven years Professor ANDREW WILES worked in complete secrecy,creating the calculation of century.

It was a calculation which brought him fame,and regret.

So I came to this. I was a 10-year-old and one day I happened to be looking in my local public library,

and I found a book on math ,and it told a bit about th history of this problem.

that someone had resolved this problem 300 years ago,but no-one had ever seen the proof,

no one have ever seen a prove,and people ever since have looked for the proof

and here was a problem that I,a 10-year-old,could understand.

but none of the great mathematicians in the past had been able to resolve,

and from that moment of course I just tried to solve it myself.

It was such a challenge,such a beautiful problem.

This problem was Fermat`s last theorem.

Pierre de Fermat was a 17th-century French mathematician 
who made some of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of numbers.

His inspiration came from studying the Arithmetica,that Ancient Greed text.

Fermat owned a copy of this book,which is book about numbers with lots of problems ,
which presumably Fremat tried to solve.

He studied it,he wrote notes int the margins.

Fermat`s original notes wre lost ,but they can still be read in a book publish by his son.

It was one of these notes that was Fermat`s greatest legacy.

And this is the fantastic observation of Master Pierre de Fermant which caused all trouble:

Cubum autem in duos cubos

This tiny note is world`s hardest mathematical problem.

It`s been unsolved for centuries.

yet it begins with an equation so simple that children know it off by heart.

The square of the hypotenuse is equal th the sum of squares of the other two sides.

Yell well that`s Pyhaagoras`s theorem isn`t it,that`s what we all did at school.

So Pythagoras`s theorem,the clever thing about it is that it tells us

when threee numbers are the sides of right-angle triangle.

That happens just when x squared plus y squared equals z squared.
