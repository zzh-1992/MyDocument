或许描述我研究数学的经历最恰当的的比方就是进入一个黑暗的大宅中

Because, when one goes into the first room and it`s dark,completely dark 

one stumbles around bumping into the furniture

gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is,

and finally after six months or so you find the light switch,you turn it on.

suddenly it`s illuminated,you can see exactly where you were.

At the beginning of September I was sitting here ath this desk.

when suddenly,totally unexpectedly,I had this incredible revelation.

It was the most important moment of my working life.

Nothing I ever do again
========================\

This is the story of one man`s  obsession with the world`s greatest mathematical problem.

For seven years Professor ANDREW WILES worked in complete secrecy,creating the calculation of century.

It was a calculation which brought him fame,and regret.

So I came to this. I was a 10-year-old and one day I happened to be looking in my local public library,

and I found a book on math ,and it told a bit about th history of this problem.

that someone had resolved this problem 300 years ago,but no-one had ever seen the proof,

no one have ever seen a prove,and people ever since have looked for the proof

and here was a problem that I,a 10-year-old,could understand.

but none of the great mathematicians in the past had been able to resolve,

and from that moment of course I just tried to solve it myself.

It was such a challenge,such a beautiful problem.

This problem was Fermat`s last theorem.

Pierre de Fermat was a 17th-century French mathematician 
who made some of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of numbers.

His inspiration came from studying the Arithmetica,that Ancient Greed text.

Fermat owned a copy of this book,which is book about numbers with lots of problems ,
which presumably Fremat tried to solve.

03:48

He studied it,he wrote notes int the margins.

Fermat`s original notes wre lost ,but they can still be read in a book publish by his son.

It was one of these notes that was Fermat`s greatest legacy.

And this is the fantastic observation of Master Pierre de Fermant which caused all trouble:

Cubum autem in duos cubos

This tiny note is world`s hardest mathematical problem.

It`s been unsolved for centuries.

yet it begins with an equation so simple that children know it off by heart.

The square of the hypotenuse is equal th the sum of squares of the other two sides.

Yell well that`s Pyhaagoras`s theorem isn`t it,that`s what we all did at school.

So Pythagoras`s theorem,the clever thing about it is that it tells us

when threee numbers are the sides of right-angle triangle.

That happens just when x squared plus y squared equals z squared.

05:00

X squared plus y squared equals z squared,and you can ask: well what are the whole numbers solutions of this equation?
x^2 + y^2 = z^2

And you quickly find there`s a solution 3 squared plus 4 squared equals 5 squared.Another one is 5 squared plus 12 
squared is 13 squared,and you go on looking and you find more and more.

So then a natural question is ,the question Fermant raised:supposing you change from squares,

supposing you replace the two by three,by four,by five,by six

by any whole number `n`,and Fermat said simply that you`ll never find any solutions , 

however far you look you`ll never find a solution

You will never find numbers that fit this equation,if n is greater than 2. 

That is what Fermat said,and what`s more,he said he could prove it.

Written in Latin,he says he has a truly wonderful proof "Demonstrationem mirabilem"

of this fact,and then the last words are:"Hance marginis exigiutas non caperet"
this margin is too small to contain this.

So Fermat said he had a proof,but he never said what it was.

Fermat made lots of marginal notes.

People took them as challenges and over the centuries,every single one of them has been disposed of,

and the last one to be disposed of is this one.

That`s why it`s called the last theorem.

Rediscovering Fermat`s proof became the ultimate challenge.

a challenge which would baffle mathematicians for the next 300 years.

Gauss,the greatest mathematician in the world,

well in the 18th-century Euler didn`t prove it.

Well you know there`s only been the one woman really Sophie Germain,

Oh there are millions,there are lots of people.

But nobody had any idea where to start.

Well mathematicians just love a challenge and this problem,this particular problem

just look so simple,it just looked as if had to have a solution.

and of couse it`s very special because Fermat said he had a solution.

Mathematicians had to prove that no numbers fitted this equation

but with the advent of computers,couldn`t they check each number one by one and show that none of them fitted?

Well how many numbers are there to beat that with?

You`ve got to do if for infinitely many numbers.

So after you`ve done it for one,how much close have you got?

Well there`s still infinitely many left.

After you`ve done it for 1000 numbers,how many,how much closer have you got?

After you`ve done a few million,there`s still infinitely many left.

In fact,you haven`t done very many have you?

A computer can never check every number.Instead,what`s needed is mathematical proof.

A mathematician is not happy until the proof complete and considered complete by the standards of mathematics.

In mathematics there`s the concept of proving something ,of knowing it with absolute certainty.

Which,well it`s called rigorous proof.

Well,that`s what mathematics,it`s all about

A prove it`s a sort of reason,it explains why no numbers fit the equation without having to check every number

After centuries of faling to have a prove.

mathematicians began to abandon Fermat in favor of more serious math.

In the 70s Fremat was no longer in fashing.

At the same time ANDREW WILES was just beginning his career as a mathematician.

He went to Cambridge as a research student under the supervision of Professor JOHN COATES.

I`ve been very fortunate to have Andrew as a student,

and even as a research student he,he was a wonderful person to work with.

He had very deep ideas then 

and it was always clear he was mathematician who would do great things.

But not with Fermat.

Everyone thought Fermat`s last theorem was impossible,so Professor Coates encouraged Andrew to forget his childhood dream

and work on more mainstream maths.

when I went to Cambridge my advisor,John Coates,

was working on lwasawa theory and elliptic curves and I started working with him.

Elliptic curves were the in thin to study,but perversely

elliptic curves are neither ellipses nor curves.

you may never have heard of elliptic curves,but they`s extremely important.

Ok,so what`s an elliptic curve?

Elliptic cures they`re not ellipses,they`re cubic curves whose solution have a shape that looks like a doughnut.

It looks so simple yet the complexity especially arithmetic complexity, is immense.

Every point on the doughnut is the solution to an equation.

Andrew Walis now studied these elliptic equations and set aside his dream.

What he didn`t realize was that on the other side of the world

elliptic curves and Fermat`s last theorem were becoming inextricably linked

I entered the University of Tokyo in 1949 and that was four years after the War.

but almost all professors were tired and lectures were not inspiring.

Goro Shimura and his fellow students had to rely on each other for inspiration.

In particular,he formed a remarkable partnership with a yong man by the name of Utaka Taniyama.

That was when I became very close to Taniyama.Taniyam was not a very careful person as a mathematician.

He made a lot of mistakes,but he made mistakes in a good direction.

So eventually he got right answers and I tried to imitate him,but I found out that it is very difficult to make good mistakes.

Together,Taniyama and Shimura worked on the complex mathematics of modular functions.

I really can`t explain what a modular function is in one sentence.

I can try and give you a few sentence to explain in.

I really can`t put it in one sentence.

Oh it`s impossible.

There`s saying attributed to Eichler that there are five fundamental operations of arithmetic:

addition,subtraction,multiplication,division and modular forms.

Modular forms are functions on the complex plane that are inordinately symmetric.

They satisfy so many internal symmetries that their mere existence

seem like accidents,but they do exist.

This image is merely a shadow of modular form.

To see one properly your TV screen would have to be stretched into something called hyperbolic space.

Bizarre modular forms seem to have nothing whatsoever to do with the humdrum world of elliptic curves.

But what Taniyama and Shimura suggested shocked everyone.

In 1955 there was an international symposium and Tyniyama posed two or three problems.

The problems posed by Taniyam led to the extraordinary claim that every elliptic curve was really a modular form in disguise.

It became known as Taniyama-Shimura conjecture.

The Taniyama-Shimura conjecture says,that every rational elliptic cures is modular

and that`s so hard to explain.

so let me explain.

Over here you have the elliptic world,the elliptic curve,these doughnuts,

and over here you have the modular world,modular forms with their many,many symmetries.

The Shirmura-Taniyama conjecture makes a bridge between these two worlds.

These worlds live on different planets.

It`s a bridge,it`s more than a bridge,it`s really a dictionary,

a dictionary where questions,intuitions,insights,theorems in the world.

I think that when Shirmura and Taniyama first started talking about the relationship between elliptic curves and modular
forms,people were very incredulous.

I wasn`t studying mathematics yet.

But the time I was a graduate student in 1969 or 1970,people were coming to believe the conjecture.

In fact,Taniyama-Shimura became a foundation for ohter theories which all came to depend on it.

But Taniyama-Shimura was only a conjecture,an unproven idea,and until it could be proved,

all the maths which relied on it were under thread.

Built more and more conjecture,stretched future and further into the future.

But they would all be completely ridiculous if Taniyama-Shimura was not true.

Proving the conjecture became crucial,

but tragically,the man whose idea inspired it didn`t to see the enormous impact of his work.

In 1958,Taniyama committed suicide.

I was very much puzzled,Puzzlement may be the best word.

Of course I was sad,see it was so sudden and 

I was unable to make sense out of this.

Taniyama-Shimura went on to become one of the great unproven conjectures.

But what did it have to do with Fermat`s last theorem?

At that time on-one had any idea that Taniyama-Shimura could have anything to do with Fermat.

Of course in the `80s that all changed completely.

Taniyama-Shimura says: every elliptic curve is modular and Fermat says: no numbers fit this equation.

What was the connection?

Well,on the face of it the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture which is obout elliptic curves, and Fermat`s last theorem have 
nothing to do with each other

because there`s no connection between Fermat and elliptic curves.

But in 1985 Gerhard Frey had this amazing idea.

Frey,a German mathematician,considered to unthinkable:what would happen if Fermat was wrong and there was a solution
to this equation after all?

Frey showed how starting with a fictitious solution to Fermat`s last equation.

if such a horrible,beast existed,he could make an elliptic curve with some very weird properties.

That elliptic curve seems to be not modular,but Shimura-Taniyama says that every elliptic curve is modular.

So if there is a solution to this equation it creates such a weired elliptic curve

it defies Taniyama-Shimura.

So in other words,if Fermat is false,so is Shimura-Tamiyama,or said differently,if Shimura-Taniyama is correct,so is 
Fermat`s last theorem.

Fermat and Taniyama-Shimura were now linked,apart from just one thing.

The problem is that Fery didn`t really prove that his elliptic curve was not modular.

He gave a plausibility argument which he hoped could be filled in by experts,and then the experts started working on it.

In theory ,you could prove Fermat by proving Taniyama,but only if Frey was right.

Frey`s idea became known ad epsilon conjecture and everyone tried to check it.
