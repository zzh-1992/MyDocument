或许描述我研究数学的经历最恰当的的比方就是进入一个黑暗的大宅中

Because, when one goes into the first room and it`s dark,completely dark 

one stumbles around bumping into the furniture

gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is,

and finally after six months or so you find the light switch,you turn it on.

suddenly it`s illuminated,you can see exactly where you were.

At the beginning of September I was sitting here ath this desk.

when suddenly,totally unexpectedly,I had this incredible revelation.

It was the most important moment of my working life.

Nothing I ever do again
========================\

This is the story of one man`s  obsession with the world`s greatest mathematical problem.

For seven years Professor ANDREW WILES worked in complete secrecy,creating the calculation of century.

It was a calculation which brought him fame,and regret.

So I came to this. I was a 10-year-old and one day I happened to be looking in my local public library,

and I found a book on math ,and it told a bit about th history of this problem.

that someone had resolved this problem 300 years ago,but no-one had ever seen the proof,

no one have ever seen a prove,and people ever since have looked for the proof

and here was a problem that I,a 10-year-old,could understand.

but none of the great mathematicians in the past had been able to resolve,

and from that moment of course I just tried to solve it myself.

It was such a challenge,such a beautiful problem.

This problem was Fermat`s last theorem.

Pierre de Fermat was a 17th-century French mathematician 
who made some of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of numbers.

His inspiration came from studying the Arithmetica,that Ancient Greed text.

Fermat owned a copy of this book,which is book about numbers with lots of problems ,
which presumably Fremat tried to solve.

03:48

He studied it,he wrote notes int the margins.

Fermat`s original notes wre lost ,but they can still be read in a book publish by his son.

It was one of these notes that was Fermat`s greatest legacy.

And this is the fantastic observation of Master Pierre de Fermant which caused all trouble:

Cubum autem in duos cubos

This tiny note is world`s hardest mathematical problem.

It`s been unsolved for centuries.

yet it begins with an equation so simple that children know it off by heart.

The square of the hypotenuse is equal th the sum of squares of the other two sides.

Yell well that`s Pyhaagoras`s theorem isn`t it,that`s what we all did at school.

So Pythagoras`s theorem,the clever thing about it is that it tells us

when threee numbers are the sides of right-angle triangle.

That happens just when x squared plus y squared equals z squared.

05:00

X squared plus y squared equals z squared,and you can ask: well what are the whole numbers solutions of this equation?
x^2 + y^2 = z^2

And you quickly find there`s a solution 3 squared plus 4 squared equals 5 squared.Another one is 5 squared plus 12 
squared is 13 squared,and you go on looking and you find more and more.

So then a natural question is ,the question Fermant raised:supposing you change from squares,

supposing you replace the two by three,by four,by five,by six

by any whole number `n`,and Fermat said simply that you`ll never find any solutions , 

however far you look you`ll never find a solution

You will never find numbers that fit this equation,if n is greater than 2. 

That is what Fermat said,and what`s more,he said he could prove it.

Written in Latin,he says he has a truly wonderful proof "Demonstrationem mirabilem"

of this fact,and then the last words are:"Hance marginis exigiutas non caperet"
this margin is too small to contain this.

So Fermat said he had a proof,but he never said what it was.

Fermat made lots of marginal notes.

People took them as challenges and over the centuries,every single one of them has been disposed of,

and the last one to be disposed of is this one.

That`s why it`s called the last theorem.

Rediscovering Fermat`s proof became the ultimate challenge.

a challenge which would baffle mathematicians for the next 300 years.

Gauss,the greatest mathematician in the world,

well in the 18th-century Euler didn`t prove it.

Well you know there`s only been the one woman really Sophie Germain,

Oh there are millions,there are lots of people.

But nobody had any idea where to start.

Well mathematicians just love a challenge and this problem,this particular problem

just look so simple,it just looked as if had to have a solution.

and of couse it`s very special because Fermat said he had a solution.

Mathematicians had to prove that no numbers fitted this equation

but with the advent of computers,couldn`t they check each number one by one and show that none of them fitted?

Well how many numbers are there to beat that with?

You`ve got to do if for infinitely many numbers.

So after you`ve done it for one,how much close have you got?

Well there`s still infinitely many left.

After you`ve done it for 1000 numbers,how many,how much closer have you got?

After you`ve done a few million,there`s still infinitely many left.

In fact,you haven`t done very many have you?

A computer can never check every number.Instead,what`s needed is mathematical proof.

A mathematician is not happy until the proof complete and considered complete by the standards of mathematics.

In mathematics there`s the concept of proving something ,of knowing it with absolute certainty.

Which,well it`s called rigorous proof.

Well,that`s what mathematics,it`s all about

A prove it`s a sort of reason,it explains why no numbers fit the equation without having to check every number

After centuries of faling to have a prove.

mathematicians began to abandon Fermat in favor of more serious math.

In the 70s Fremat was no longer in fashing.

At the same time ANDREW WILES was just beginning his career as a mathematician.

He went to Cambridge as a research student under the supervision of Professor JOHN COATES.

I`ve been very fortunate to have Andrew as a student,

and even as a research student he,he was a wonderful person to work with.

He had very deep ideas then 

and it was always clear he was mathematician who would do great things.

But not with Fermat.

Everyone thought Fermat`s last theorem was impossible,so Professor Coates encouraged Andrew to forget his childhood dream

and work on more mainstream maths.

when I went to Cambridge my advisor,John Coates,

was working on lwasawa theory and elliptic curves and I started working with him.

Elliptic curves were the in thin to study,but perversely

elliptic curves are neither ellipses nor curves.

you may never have heard of elliptic curves,but they`s extremely important.

Ok,so what`s an elliptic curve?

Elliptic cures they`re not ellipses,they`re cubic curves whose solution have a shape that looks like a doughnut.

It looks so simple yet the complexity especially arithmetic complexity, is immense.

Every point on the doughnut is the solution to an equation.

Andrew Walis now studied these elliptic equations and set aside his dream.

What he didn`t realize was that on the other side of the world

elliptic curves and Fermat`s last theorem were becoming inextricably linked

I entered the University of Tokyo in 1949 and that was four years after the War.

but almost all professors were tired and lectures were not inspiring.

Goro Shimura and his fellow students had to rely on each other for inspiration.

In particular,he formed a remarkable partnership with a yong man by the name of Utaka Taniyama.

That was when I became very close to Taniyama.Taniyam was not a very careful person as a mathematician.

He made a lot of mistakes,but he made mistakes in a good direction.

So eventually he got right answers and I tried to imitate him,but I found out that it is very difficult to make good mistakes.

Together,Taniyama and Shimura worked on the complex mathematics of modular functions.

I really can`t explain what a modular function is in one sentence.

I can try and give you a few sentence to explain in.

I really can`t put it in one sentence.

Oh it`s impossible.

There`s saying attributed to Eichler that there are five fundamental operations of arithmetic:

addition,subtraction,multiplication,division and modular forms.

Modular forms are functions on the complex plane that are inordinately symmetric.

They satisfy so many internal symmetries that their mere existence

seem like accidents,but they do exist.

This image is merely a shadow of modular form.

To see one properly your TV screen would have to be stretched into something called hyperbolic space.

Bizarre modular forms seem to have nothing whatsoever to do with the humdrum world of elliptic curves.

But what Taniyama and Shimura suggested shocked everyone.

In 1955 there was an international symposium and Tyniyama posed two or three problems.

The problems posed by Taniyam led to the extraordinary claim that every elliptic curve was really a modular form in disguise.

It became known as Taniyama-Shimura conjecture.

The Taniyama-Shimura conjecture says,that every rational elliptic cures is modular

and that`s so hard to explain.

so let me explain.

Over here you have the elliptic world,the elliptic curve,these doughnuts,

and over here you have the modular world,modular forms with their many,many symmetries.

The Shirmura-Taniyama conjecture makes a bridge between these two worlds.

These worlds live on different planets.

It`s a bridge,it`s more than a bridge,it`s really a dictionary,

a dictionary where questions,intuitions,insights,theorems in the world.

I think that when Shirmura and Taniyama first started talking about the relationship between elliptic curves and modular
forms,people were very incredulous.

I wasn`t studying mathematics yet.

But the time I was a graduate student in 1969 or 1970,people were coming to believe the conjecture.

In fact,Taniyama-Shimura became a foundation for ohter theories which all came to depend on it.

But Taniyama-Shimura was only a conjecture,an unproven idea,and until it could be proved,

all the maths which relied on it were under thread.

Built more and more conjecture,stretched future and further into the future.

But they would all be completely ridiculous if Taniyama-Shimura was not true.

Proving the conjecture became crucial,

but tragically,the man whose idea inspired it didn`t to see the enormous impact of his work.

In 1958,Taniyama committed suicide.

I was very much puzzled,Puzzlement may be the best word.

Of course I was sad,see it was so sudden and 

I was unable to make sense out of this.

Taniyama-Shimura went on to become one of the great unproven conjectures.

But what did it have to do with Fermat`s last theorem?

At that time on-one had any idea that Taniyama-Shimura could have anything to do with Fermat.

Of course in the `80s that all changed completely.

Taniyama-Shimura says: every elliptic curve is modular and Fermat says: no numbers fit this equation.

What was the connection?

Well,on the face of it the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture which is obout elliptic curves, and Fermat`s last theorem have 
nothing to do with each other

because there`s no connection between Fermat and elliptic curves.

But in 1985 Gerhard Frey had this amazing idea.

Frey,a German mathematician,considered to unthinkable:what would happen if Fermat was wrong and there was a solution
to this equation after all?

Frey showed how starting with a fictitious solution to Fermat`s last equation.

if such a horrible,beast existed,he could make an elliptic curve with some very weird properties.

That elliptic curve seems to be not modular,but Shimura-Taniyama says that every elliptic curve is modular.

So if there is a solution to this equation it creates such a weired elliptic curve

it defies Taniyama-Shimura.

So in other words,if Fermat is false,so is Shimura-Tamiyama,or said differently,if Shimura-Taniyama is correct,so is 
Fermat`s last theorem.

Fermat and Taniyama-Shimura were now linked,apart from just one thing.

The problem is that Fery didn`t really prove that his elliptic curve was not modular.

He gave a plausibility argument which he hoped could be filled in by experts,and then the experts started working on it.

In theory ,you could prove Fermat by proving Taniyama,but only if Frey was right.

Frey`s idea became known ad epsilon conjecture and everyone tried to check it.

One year later, in San Francisco, there was a breakthrough.

I saw BARRY MAZUR on the campus and I said let`s go for a cup of coffee. and we sat down for cappuccinos at this cafe.

and I looked at Barry and I said you know,I`m trying to generalise what I`ve done so that we can prove.

the full strength of Serre`s epsillon conjecture.

Barry kooked at me and said well you`ve done it already, all you have to do is add on some extra gamma zero of m structure.

and run through your argument and it still works,and that gives everything you need,

and this had never occurred to me as simple as it sounds.

I looked at Barry,I looked to my cappuccino,I looked back at Barry and said my Fod,you`re absolutely right

Ken`s ideas was brilliant.

I was at a friend`s house sipping iced tea early in the evening

and he just mentioned casually in the middle of a conversion:by the way,do you hear that Ken has proved  the epsilon conjecture?

And I was just electrified.

I knew that moment the course of my life was changing,because this meant that to prove Fermat`s last theorem,

I just had to prove Taniyama-Shimura conjecture.

From that moment that was what I was working on.

I just kenw I would go home and work ont th Taniyama-Shimura conjecture.

Andrew abandoned all his other research.He cut himself off from the rest of the wold and for the next seven years

he concentrated solely on his childhood passion.I never use a computer,I sometimes might scribble,I do doodles,

I start trying to find patterns really,so I`m doing calculations,which try to explain some little piece of mathematics

and I`m trying to fit it in with some previous broad conceptual understanding of some branch of mathematics.

Sometimes that`ll involve going and looking up in a book to see how it`s done there,

Sometimes is`s a question of modifying things a bit,sometimes doing a little extra calculation,

and sometimes you realise that nothing ths`s ever been done before is any use at all.

and you just have to find something completely new.and it`s a mystery where it comes from.

I must confess I did not think that the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture was accessible to proof a present. 

I thought I probably wouldn`t see a proof im my lifetime.

I was one the vast majority of  people who believe that the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture was just completely inaccessible,

and I didn`t bother to prove it,even think about trying to prove it.

ANDREW WILES is probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove
this conjecture.

In this case certainly for the first several years I had no fear of competition.

I simply didn`t think I or any one else had any real idea how to do it.

Andrew was embarking on one of the most complex calculations in history.

For the fist two years,his did nothing but immerse himself in the problem.Trying to find a strategy which might work.

So it was now known that Taniyama-Shimura implied Fermat`s last theorem.

What does Taniyama-Shimura say?

It says that all elliptic curves should be modular

Well this was an old problem,been around for 20 years and lots of people would try to solve it.

Now one way of looking at it is that you have all elliptic curves and then you have the modular elliptic curves.

and you want to prove that there are the same number of each.

Now of course you`re talking about infinite sets,so you can`t count them per say,

but you can diveded them into packets and you could try to count each packet and see how things gone

and this proves to be a very attractive idea for about 30 seconds,but you can`t really get much further than that 

and the big question on the subject was how you could possibly count, and in fact,Wiles introduced the correct technique.

Andrew`s trick was to transform the elliptic curves into something called Galois representations.

which would make counting easier.

Now it was a question of comparing modular forms with Galois representations,not elliptic curves.

Now you might ask and it`s an obvious question,why can`t you do this with elliptic curves and modular forms,

why couldn`t you count elliptic curves,count modular forms,show ther`re the same number?

Well,the answer is people thied and they never found a way of counting,and this was why this is key breakthrough,

that I found a way to count not the original problem,but the modified problem.

I found a way to count modular forms and Galoisrepresentation.

This is only the first step and have already taken 3 years of Andrew`s life.

My wife`s only konwn me while I`ve been working on Fermat.

I told her a few days after we got married.I decided that I really only had time for my problem and my family.

So I`d found this wonderful counting mechanism and I stated thinking about this concrete problem in terms of lwasawa theory.

Iwasawa theory was the student subject I`d studied as a graduate student and 

in fact with my advisor,JOHN COATES,I`d used it to analyse elliptic curves.

Iwasawa theory was supposed to help create something called a class umber formula.

but several months passed and the class number formula remained out of reach.

So,at the end of the summer of `91 I was at a conference.

JOHN COATES told me about a wonderful new paper of Matthias Flach. a student of his,in which he had tackled c class number formula.

in fact exactly the class number formula I needed.

so Flach,using ideas of Kolyvagin,had made a very significant first step,in actually producing the class number formula.

So at that point I thought this is just what I need,this is tailor-made for the problem.

I put aside completely the old approach I`d been trying and I devoted myself day and night to extending his result.

Andrew was almost there,but his breakthrough was risky and complicated.

Ather six years of secrecy,he needed to confide in someone.

January of 1993 Andrea came up to me one day at tea,asked me if I could come up to his office,

there was something he wanted to talk to me about.I had no idea what,what this could be.

Went up to his office,he closed the door,he said he thought he would be able to prove Taniyama-Shimura.

I was just amazed,this was fantastic.

It involved a kind of mathematics that NICK KATZ is an expert in.

I think another reason he asked me was that he was suer I would not tell other people,

I would keep my mouth shut,which I did.

ANDERW WILES and NICK KATZ had been spending rather a lot of time,

huddled over a coffee table at the far end of common room working on some problem or other.We never knew what it was.

In order not to arouse any more suspicion,Andrew decided to check his proof by disguising it in a course of lecture which
NICK KATZ could than attend.

Well I explained at the beginning of the course that Flach had written this beautiful paper.

and I wanted to try to extend it to prove the full class number formula.

The only thing I didn`t explain was that proving the class number formula was most of the way to Fermat`s last theorem.

So this course was announced.It said calculations on elliptic curves,which could mean anything.

Didn`t mention Fermat,didn`t mention Taniyama-Shimura,

there was no way in the world anyone could have guessed that it was about that,if you didn`t already konw.

None of the graduate students kenw and in a few weeks they just drifted off.

because it`s impossible to follow stuff if you don`t know what it`s for,pretty much.

It`s pretty hard even if you do konw what`s if for,but after a few weeks I was the only guy in the audience.

The lectures revealed no errors and still none of his colleagues suspected why Andrew was being so secretive.

Maybe he`s run out of ideas. That`s why he`s quiet,you never konw why ther`re quiet.

The proof was still missing a vital ingredient.

but Andrew now felt confident.

It was time to tell one more person.

So I called up Peter and asked him if I could come round and talk to him about something.

I got a phone call from Andrew saying that he had something very important he wanted to chat to me about.

and sure enough he had some very exciting news.

I said I think you better sit down for this.

I said I think I`m about to prove Fermat`s last throrem.

I was flabbergasted,excited,disturbed.

I mean I remember that night finding it quit difficult to sleep.

But there was still a problem.

Late in the spring of `93 I was in this very awkward position and I thought I`d got most of the curves to te modular.

so that was nearly enough to be content to have Fermat`s last theorem.

but there was this,there few families of elliptic curves that had escaped the net.

I was sitting here at my desk in May of`93,still wondering about this problem.

and I was casually glancing at paper BARRY MAZUR`s

and there was just one sentence which made a reference to actually what`s a 19th-century construction.

and I just instantly realized that there was a trick that I could use,

that I could switch from the families of elliptic curves I`d been using

I`d been studying them using the prime three.

I could switch and study them using the prime five.

It looked more complicated,but I could switch from these awkward curves

that I couldn`t prove were modular,to a different set of curves which I`d already proved were modular.

and use that information to just go that one last step.

I just kept working out the details.

time went by and I forgot to go down to lunch.

It got to about teatime,I went down and Nada was very surprised that I`d arrived so late.

and then I told her that I,I believed I`d solved Fermat`s last theorem.

I was convinced that I had Fermat in my hands

and there was a conference in Cambridge organised by my advisor,JOHN COATES.

I thought that would be a wonderful place.

It`s my old home town,I`d been a graduate student there,be a wonderful place to talk about it if I could get it in
good shape.

The name of the lectures that he announced was simply Elliptic curves and modular forms.

There was no mention of Fermat`s last theorem.

Well I was at this conference on L functions and elliptic curves.

and it was kind of a standard conference and all of the people were there.

didn`t seem to be anything out of the ordinary.

until people started telling me that they`d been hearing weird rumours about ANDERW WILE`s proposed series of lecture.

I started talking to people and I got more and more precise information.I`ve no idea how it was spread.

Not from me.

Whenever any piece of mathematical news had been in the air,

Peter would say ot that`s nothing,wait until you hear the bing news.

there`s something bing going to break.

Maybe some hints,yeah.

People would ask me leading up to my lectures what exactly I was going to say.

and I said,come to my lecture and see.

It was a very charged atmosphere,a lot of major figures of arithmetical algebraic geometry were there.

Well I`d never seen a lecture series in mathematics like that before.

What was unique about those lecture were the glorious ides.

how many new ideas were presented,and the constancy of his dramatic build-up that was suspenseful until the enc.

There was this marvellous moment when we were coming close to a proof of Fermat`s last theorem.

and the tension had build up and there was only one possible punchline.
